The base game files used for creating this mod are from 1.8.0 (no relevant changes were made in 1.8.1)
Mod files begin with the mod identifier where possible.  
For this mod that is: khd = Mod identifier (K for Kalanyr, the author name) and then Harem Doctrines (for the mod name)
khd00 files indicate new files, khd01 files indicate extensions of an existing 00 file (that may override some functions), etc names that exactly match existing files overwrite those files entirely (which is necessary for GUI / Event files) )
